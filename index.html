              With the enormous technological advancement, it has been
              acknowledged that the computer has transcended its given duty of
              computing and has evolved into an electronic brain with far
              broader capabilities. Computer science has evolved into a
              discipline that aids in the advancement of other fields such as
              health care, environmental science, and engineering, among others.
              Undergraduate majors in Computer Science (CS) provide students
              with a broad and robust knowledge basis, as well as technical
              skills and a high capability for problem solving.The University is
              concerned with providing students with the essential scientific
              knowledge and experience to work in media institutions. It is also
              interested in providing them with additional training sessions
              through university-sponsored specialty courses. Students will be
              able to do study and access information at the university library,
              which includes a huge number of essential and new resources and
              books. The Department of Media at USAL has created a studio on
              campus that is equipped with the most up-to-date technical and
              modern equipment and tools, allowing students to complete their
              media training. The studio provides a setting that is comparable
              to real-world working situations.
